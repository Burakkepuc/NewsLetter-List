# NewsLetter-List
My First Back End Application  

It is a basic mail list app. I'm getting subscribers via api and I can send them mail on admin panel.  
I learned back end technologies such as nodejs , expressjs , routing ,heroku deploying app, git,unix command line commands etc. It was huge and excited for me !
I use bootstrap css and html for front end.
